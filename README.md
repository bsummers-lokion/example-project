# Example project

- This file was added as the first commit to the `main` branch in a new repository. That's it.
- This file was modified as the first commit to the `develop` branch in an existing repository.
- This file was modified to change the verb tenses on the two lines above from `is` to `was` because it looked weird.
- A sample Rust application that prints Hello World was added to this repository using `cargo init`.
